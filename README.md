# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey


#About me
My name is Nico, I am from San Jose, California and I am currently attending West Valley College. Some of my hobbies are surfing, hanging out with friends, and playing video games.


#Goals for This Course
My goals for this course are to find out if this is something that I like doing or have an affinity for. My last 2 semesters I was taking business coursework, but I didn't like it at all.


#My First Python Program
`print("Hello World!")`
